Partial Encryption:
    i encrypted only the message part and not the other fields, because
    this way still provides some level of confidentiality for the message 
    content while allowing server-side operations like filtering and sorting
    to be performed efficiently.

Message Size Issue:
    -> when the data is encrypted the size of the message increses exponentially.
    -> Sending an message of incresed size can cause problems like
        - Network Limitations: WebSocket messages or HTTP requests may have size limits
        - Performance: Large messages can consume more bandwidth and take longer to transmit over the network
        - Server Load: Handling large messages on the server side can increase resource consumption, including CPU, memory.
    
    -> To takle this issue we can use
        - Chunking: Spliting the large message into small parts (This can avoid network size limitations)
        - Compression: Compress message payloads before transmission to reduce their size.
